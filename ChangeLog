2011-09-13: (ES) Update of the first bootstrap step
There was a bug in the generation of visited flags
missed in the last update. The test target of the
Makefile has been updated to prevent this in the future.
It know depends on the "jar" target and not only the
"all" target. Test 117 was added to expose the bug in
the previous bootstrapping attempt.
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-09-08: (ES) Update of generated code for java5
There was a name collison when generating java5 code
due to an added method with a generic return type.
The offending method "Iterator ASTDecl.getClassBodyDecls"
was renamed to "Iterator ASTDecl.getClassBodyDeclsItr".
The java5 generated method could have been used with
some adjustments (it generates a list which could be
used to get an iterator) but this would not work for
java1.4 code.
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-09-08: (ES) First bootstrap step
Did a bootstrap with the java1.4 flag on. Updated the
refinement syntax in JragCodeGen.jrag and hand to rename
the "String ASTDecl.flushCollectionCache" to 
"String ASTDecl.flushCollectionCacheString" to prevent
a collision with the now generated 
"void ASTDecl.flushCollectionCache".
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-09-08: (ES) Added generation of java1.4 code
The previous generation of java1.4 code for circular attributes
resulted in java5 code.
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-09-08: (ES) Preparing for boostrap
Changed the Makefile so that jastadd is run with the "--java1.4"
flag to avoid version related compile errors.
Changed the use of "refine" in JragCodeGen.jrag to use
the "refined()" construct instead of the "A.C.m()" construct.
The tests for the latter alternative fails.
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-09-08: (ES) Added support for refinement of grammar generated methods
(from .ast) via an "Ast" aspect. 
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-09-08: (ES) Added tests for refine (110-116)
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-09-02: (JO) Changed the name of the RagDoll tag
apilvl to apilevel
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-05-31: (JO) Added JavaDoc tag output for attributes
and methods.
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-05-31: (JO) Added test target to Makefile.
You can use make test to run all the unit tests and
compare the test results with expected test results.
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-05-10: (JO) Added WINDOWS / CYGWIN notes to README
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-05-09: (JO) ASTNode Java error fixed
Changed type of node parameter in setChild and insertChild to ASTNode.
This change fixes Java errors that previously were undetected by javac,
but with the latest JDK7 versions from Oracle these errors are reported.
The error was access of childIndex in a context where that field is not
visible.
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-05-06: (GH) Added reference-manual, release-notes, and release script.
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-04-25: (GH) Revised tests
Added .info files for test documentation.
RunTests now uses JastAdd2.jar instead of class files.
RunTests now runs JastAdd2.jar as exec process to avoid exit at generation-time errors.
RunTests now accepts tests from 1 to 200.
Added test case Test101.
Refactored some tests to make them succeed under JastAdd2.
--------------------------------------------------------
2011-04-06: (GH) Added documentation files in JastAdd2
Added readme, change log file, etc.
