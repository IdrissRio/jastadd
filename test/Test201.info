AST: legacy refine syntax
JastAdd2 uses pattern matching to replace the "refined" keyword with the method
name of the refined method. This pattern also works inside string literals and
comments. The pattern matching should be sensitive to word boundaries so that
for example the substring "refined" in the string "unrefined" does match
this pattern.
